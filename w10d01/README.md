### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources
- [x] Returning JSON

### Rails Week Convo
* I love rails. and I hate rails.
* You can use rails competently without knowing Ruby
* Rails takes care of details behind the scenes
* I like how Ruby/Rails works on the backend (routing)
* You just need to know the Rails syntax
* It's really high level and abstract (not sure if a fan)
* AR binds properties to the model (don't need to define)

### Model View Controller (MVC/MVCR)
* Model - abstraction layer around the database
* View - template language (helper functions)
* Controller - brains of the operation (manager)
* Router - decides which controller to send the request to
